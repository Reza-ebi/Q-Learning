# Q-Learning
AI-Based Decision Making Using Q-Learning ( Reinforcement Learning )
# Q-Learning Demo in Python

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of Q-Learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm, in a simple grid world environment.

## Features
- 5x5 grid with obstacles and a goal
- Reward-based learning with negative and positive feedback
- Visualization of the learned path using matplotlib
- Pure Python + NumPy + Matplotlib

## Run it yourself
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python q_learning.py
